# Python Concepts Journal

A personal record of Python concepts I explore — from everyday features to advanced techniques.  
This repository serves as a growing reference and learning log, documenting ideas, examples, and explanations I’ve studied.

## What You'll Find
- **Core Python Refreshers** – revisiting important but often overlooked basics.
- **Advanced Topics** – deep dives into language internals and power features.
- **Practical Patterns** – real-world coding approaches and tips.
- **Performance Insights** – optimization techniques and gotchas.

## Purpose
To consolidate my Python learning journey in one place — both as a future reference and as a resource for others.

## Structure
Each concept is stored in its own file or folder, with:
- Explanation
- Code examples
- Links to relevant resources
